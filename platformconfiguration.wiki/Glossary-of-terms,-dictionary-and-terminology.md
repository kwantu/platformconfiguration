# Introduction
This page exists for similar reasons to the [Github wiki Notational conventions, tricks and traps]() page. In terms of consistency of semantics and syntax, new technologies inevitably involve the invention of new concepts and ideas for which there is no existing naming convention. This process is natural and continually evolving, as communication on projects is a vital ingredient for success. However, it is often iterative as the same subject is discussed between different team members and without recognition of the fact that a new term or phrase has just been coined, that term can be misunderstood or even misleading if not given adequate consideration at its inception.  

It is important to have terms that mean what they are. Terms usually begin with a natural language metaphoric description for the concept or idea that is being referred to and then mutate into a shortened and more convenient form, eventually becoming part of the nomenclature of the project environment. During this process, there are often ideas and concepts that are similar, but differ in some fundamental way.  For example a class and instance of a class in a taxonomical hierarchy where: a "vacuum cleaner" can become incorrectly known as a "hoover". For that reason, this page exists to help both the project team and wiki maintainers to attain clarity in their written and spoken communication. Some terms may at first seem innocuous and obvious in what they mean to the project team members, but may have other meanings and connotations to new team members and users of the product, who need certainty, clarification and disambiguation to build their own mental models.

|data model         | This term has been used to mean something akin to a data profile, but the way it looks when it is in memory in the app rather than the way it is stored in the community database.|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/elSelect) <br> [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Create-an-app)|
|data object        | A Data Object, abbreviated to (DO or SDO) in this wiki, is the mechanism by which the platform knows about data. It is the data about the data. It is the meta data. It is a prerequisite for views workflows, searches and reports... all of which comprise an app. |[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Data-Objects)|
|data object envelope| This refers to the XML file containing the data object definition. The "data object envelope" includes a set of core fields that are always available. This ensures interoperability between data objects.|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Standard-data-envelope) <br>  [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Data-object-configuration-file)|
|data profile       | A profile is the word used to describe the ("in-memory instance" or "data model") of the data object when it is stored as a file in the community database| [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/elSelect) <br> [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Create-an-app) |
|data Registry      | A list of apps created by different organisations that may be shared with specific communities. Communities using a shared app may also share data collected using that app back to the Data Registry to aggregate across communities |[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki#data-registry) |
|data type          | The dataType attribute ensures that only that data type can be captured into a field of a data object.

|element type       | Element types are the building blocks of views on a data object. They originate in the data object. There are only 4 element types, ie: (`elfield`, `elSelect`, `elUpload` and `elRepeat`). A type of field in an indicator set (for example a date picker, bio-metric identification element, geo-location, or drop down menu) |[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Data-object-elements) |
|Element blocks     | aka Element building blocks. Each element type contains (or is made up of) reusable blocks called "element blocks": ie: ( `displays`, `data`, `fieldData`, `validations`, `help` )| [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Data-object-component#6-element-building-blocks) |
|field              | Fields originate in the DO. A DO mostly has multiple views (at least an "edit" and a "readonly" view) on it and the number is unlimited. Elements in the view model can contain one field each. In the case of the `elRepeat` which defines a table, each cell in the table is a field within the element.  The data dictionary contains a list of all forms, the fields that they contain, the definition for each field (e.g. date, number, text etc.), any validations for the field and any help text.|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Fields-in-Data-Objects) <br> [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-modules-terminology#data-dictionary)|
|form               | When an Element has multiple fields in it, it is often referred to as a form from the user interface perspective. The element's fields can be rendered in a panel, or a collapsible panel called an accordion. The fields on a for come from a data object. The data dictionary contains a list of all forms, the fields that they contain, the definition for each field (e.g. date, number, text etc.), any validations for the field and any help text.|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-modules-terminology#forms) <br> [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/How-to-configure-a-form-with-validate,-save-as-draft-and-save) <br> [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/How-to-configure-a-form-without-an-accordion) <br> [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-modules-terminology#data-dictionary)|
|functional module  | Also known as a 'module', it is a component in the platform.  Examples include the <br> workflow component, <br> taxonomy component, <br> search component and <br> reports component|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-modules-terminology) |

|indicator set      | A data collection form that can be used across multiple apps|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Workflow-configuration) |
|indicator set instance| This is an instance of a category of an "_indicator set_". For example, a meeting form may be completed multiple times by different people. Each person will create a new instance. If the same instance is edited it will create a new _sequence_.|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Workflow-configuration) |
|indicator set category| This is a type of data collection form. For example a meeting form, a participant form or a project form|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Workflow-actions) |
|linkages           | Is a user interface mechanism used to link two data object instances, defining a relationship between them. For example in a list of contacts with contact details, two contact forms could be linked, defining one contact as being (the sister or some other kind of relative) of the other. |[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-modules-terminology#linkages)|
|module             | Also known as a 'functional module', it is a component in the platform.  Examples include the <br> workflow component, <br> taxonomy component, <br> search component and <br> reports component|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-modules-terminology) |

The default code value is "en" for English.| |
|pages              | Apps are created with a core set of pages. These may be hidden from users with page level permissions. There are also optional pages that may be added to your app. |[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/App#pages)|
|panel              | The `panelSet` is a more advanced layout concept that allows for the grouping of components and display objects into a single visual UI feature. It can be configured in accordions, tabs or wizard structure |[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Data-object-PanelSet-tag) |
|panel set          | ??? |[tolink]()| <rob>
|periodic workflow  | Is the mechanism that accommodates processes that repeat according to a specific frequency. This may be monthly, quarterly or annually.

|sub-process        | Process, sub-process and step are hierarchical levels used to decompose a specific business process in the workflow. Instances of these are created as a business object enters the workflow. The location in the workflow is represented by a status in the instance. |[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Workflow)  <br> [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Notifications) <br> [link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/How-to-configure-notifications)|

|table              | A table is like a grid. The `elRepeat` is the way the platform implements a user interface grid. (In the Kwantu platform there is no concept like a database table. The closest thing to a database table is the following set of closely related terms [data object, data-model, profile].) |[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/elRepeat) |
|tabs               | A tab is part of a `panelSet`.|[link](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Data-object-PanelSet-tag)|
