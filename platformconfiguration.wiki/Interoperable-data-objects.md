Data objects are defined using a domain specific language.  This provides a standardised way of describing the way in which DO data can be viewed and edited.  This means that DOs are effectively micro-applications that enable users to view and edit the data they contain in a standard web browser or generic application.  DOs may also be transformed into other formats that enable them to be viewed and edited by other applications.  This avoids the need for duplicate work in different applications to implement view and edit models for data.
