# Introduction
This page describes what business analysis an (organisation or enterprise) has to do in order to write a specification for a Kwantu platform developer / administrator to enable them to develop an app that solves a business process administration application problem.

The specification must contain a high level description and the detail (to the level of what the user sees on the screen) of the business process that will be modelled in the app and it must also describe the following:
* what the [data objects](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-Entity-list#data-objects) are 
* how [data objects](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-Entity-list#data-objects) relate to each other
* what the screens will look-like in the context of a Kwantu platform app
* how the user interacts witheach field on the screen and what is may and may not contain
* how the app will use the [data objects](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-Entity-list#data-objects)
* What the various possible [workflows](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Workflow) are that may change [data objects](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Kwantu-Entity-list#data-objects) field values
* what the rules are that must be satisfied before an instance of the data can be saved
* How data objects interrelate in order to: join; report on; and interface the data in and out of the system
