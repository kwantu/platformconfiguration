The Kwantu app generation engine requires the following **input framework**:

### 1. What does a Kwantu app model?
* An app relates to business processes.   For this reason it has a flexibly configurable hierarchical workflow engine to accommodate multilevel business process steps. 
* An app records & manages a transaction of interaction between two business entities the remain relatively static. (For example: a sale of an item to a customer resulting in an invoice)
* How to understand and model a business process.   Business processes are best modelled using the Tetrarch method.   That is to say, begin with a top level of (7 +- 1) steps that represent the whole process from end to end.   Then expand each business step into a second layer of greater detail of (7 +- 1) steps.  Repeat this process as many times as necessary to ensure that every step is broken down to its atomic components. 
* principles and rules that define an app...

### 2. How is hierarchy modelled in the app?   
Hierarchy is modelled in an app as a multilevel set of steps, each level representing a finer grain on the one before, like an inverted tree structure.
* what is a profile.   A profile is [...]()
* do we need sub-profiles?

### 3. How are things organised in an app?
* Hierarchy. Everything in the app is arranged into hierarchy in the tetrarch style. This includes the configuration files and the files that are output by the application generation engine.

### 4. How are app resources shared?
* [Data Objects](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Data-Objects) and [Taxonomy](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Taxonomies)

### 5. What defines the boundaries between apps?
* Explain the building blocks  & what they are suited for.
* Guiding principles and examples.
