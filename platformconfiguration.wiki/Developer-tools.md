**The Kwantu platform is fundamentally (web and mobile) based. Development of apps on the platform requires the ability to edit XML and JASON files and access to the World-Wide-Web in the process of developing, testing and running apps.**

### The Kwantu team 
The Kwantu team uses:
* The proprietary [Oxygen](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_developer/download_oxygenxml_developer.html) XML Editor for editing XML files; and 
* The free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor for Node.JS development and editing JSON files.
* Chrome and Firefox browsers

### The Kwantu platform
The Kwantu platform uses the [CouchDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_CouchDB) database to store all aspects of applications and data. To access this database the [Restlet Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/restlet-client-rest-api-t/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm?hl=en) plugin for the Google Chrome browser is used (see [Rester](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rester/) for Firefox) for the following purposes:
* REST API Testing; and 
* The storage and retrieval of configuration file documents.  

See how to use the [Restlet Client]().

### Windows
The following tools are free and in wide use on the proprietary Windows operating systems:
* [XML Notepad 2007](https://www.microsoft.com/en-za/download/details.aspx?id=7973) for editing XML files. The outstanding feature of this XML editor is the classic Norton Utilities two panel interface of hierarchy and contents. This is a great way to develop a grasp of the layout of configuration files.
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.html) for editing syntax-highlighted JASON files (and a vast array of languages). The outstanding feature of this code editor is the ability to use the **Ctrl + Alt + Left mouse button**
to highlight, edit and move rectangular blocks of text.

Much has been written about porting these tools to Ubuntu Gnu + Linux
