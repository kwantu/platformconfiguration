# Introduction
Dashboards are a high level summary of reporting data extracted from Data-objects (SDO's). They are intended to give the organisation an immediate view of its key performance indicators and whether they are within operational parameters. It is possible to drill into the detail of a dashboard to explore the contributions of underlying locations, dates & times, and organisational categorisations.
