The adoption profile title is shown in the breadcrumbs.  By default this shows the UUID of the adoption profile.

We can change this to something clearer by editing the processes file for the adoption profile and updating the title field.

**Questions:** 
* Is the _adoption profile_  mentioned above, a concept which is expressed in the adoption-config-file?
* Is the "_breadcrumbs_" mentioned above, a concept representing the way the _adoption profile_ is linked via the _UUID_ to other configuration files of an application developed in the Kwantu platform?
