A module is also known as a 'functional module', which is a component in the platform. Kwantu modules include the following [components]() as examples: the workflow component, taxonomy component, search component and reports component.

# Forms 
Kwantu forms can be created in multiple languages, enabling users to switch language as they choose.  They can include complex calculations and validations.  Different forms may be linked to enable connections between data.  Users may comment on form data saved.  Forms may also be linked to workflow, which defines what action is taken after the form is saved or edited.  This could include notifying a user of an action that they need to take.

# Workflow
Kwantu includes a fully configurable workflow engine.  This can be used to define a sequential series of steps that follow a process.  Workflow can then be used to control which users may take which actions or view which data at each step.  Workflow is often used to manage monthly or annual repetitive tasks, ensuring that specific forms are completed, reviewed or updated by specified users at the right time.  Process defined in the process manual are mirrored in the workflow.

# Search
The search component is the key to analysing and utilising your data. Use the search component to create a query to extract your data for analysis or to show on a page. The search component makes it easy to find exactly what you want. The simple user interface lets you create queries based on criteria like:

* Which form(s) have the data you need
* If they were saved on, before or within a specific date range
* Who saved them or edited them?
* Which stage of the workflow they have reached
* Which taxonomy term(s) have been used to tag them

Using these and other criteria you can create very precise search queries quickly and easily. Once configured you can display the search results on any page of your community or on a profile page.

# Reports
The reports module enables you to create your own report templates.  These can then be displayed on any page, enabling your users to export data in real time.  When configuring a report, you can select which fields from which forms are included on the report.  You may also add your own heading for that field.  Reports can be downloaded as a PDF, Rich Text or XLS file.

This module will enable staff to create or update reports at any time.  The reports module will draw on the data dictionary (see below) to enable the report to include any field from any form.  This will provide enormous flexibility in terms of the types of questions that reports can answer.  Providing the field exists to collect data, it can be included in a report.  The tool will also provide the option to compare data over time to identify trends.

The module will in the future include the ability to configure dashboards that render data on charts and maps.  This will enable the option to present data visually in a way that helps to make decisions.

# User roles 
Kwantu uses roles to determine what a user can and cannot do. Any user can be associated with one or more role. Once defined, roles can be given permission to view, edit or delete any content, page or component on your system. This gives you the ability to define granular access.

# Taxonomy
The taxonomy component is used to manage pre-defined lists of keywords. Taxonomies are an important part of your information architecture. They ensure that different members of your team are cross-referencing data they collect in the same way. For example, you might create a taxonomy listing a set of age ranges, places or types of stakeholders. Using taxonomies makes your analysis faster, as your data is already coded.

# Linkages
The linkages component is used to link two objects and define a relationship between them. For example, you could link two contact forms and define one as being the sister of the other. The linkages component lets users choose from a taxonomy to select which relationship they want to specify between two objects.

# Notifications
The workflow module is linked to notifications.  This module generates an alert to notify a user that the workflow has assigned an action to them.  This helps users to know when the system has requested that they review and approve data or capture data, for example.

# Data Dictionary
The application will include a comprehensive data dictionary that can be exported to an XLS file.  This will show a list of all forms, the fields that they contain, the definition for each field (e.g. date, number, text etc.), any validations for the field and any help text.  The data dictionary is at the heart of the reports module, making it possible for you to generate new reports that draw on any field in any form.
