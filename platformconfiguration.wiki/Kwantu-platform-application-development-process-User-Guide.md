# Introduction

This page describes what the developer of apps on the Kwantu platform needs to do, to develop a typical "_business process management app_". All Kwantu apps are essentially "_process management apps_", though the platform can be applied to other problems that lend themselves to the Kwantu platform solution anatomy as well.

**Prerequisites for developing an app**

(ie. what must be in place first before an app development begins)

The development process or SDLC (systems development life cycle) begins when the following list of things is in place:
1. The business uses the Kwantu platform as part of its solution architecture.
1. The Kwantu platform software is installed on a server belonging to the organisation or enterprise.
1. The business has a problem which needs to be solved with a computerised solution, and fits the Kwantu platform app template.
1. Analysis of the business problem must be done and a specification for the app development must be written.
1. There is at least one developer / administrator available to do the configuration work.
1. The developer / administrator is familiar with the configuration of files required for the development.
