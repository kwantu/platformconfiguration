When configuring a report, if the view contains a repeat structure, the report will duplicate fields for all columns when there are multiple rows of data in a repeat.  Since this appears confusing, there is an option to instead leave the duplicate rows blank.

In this case the primary fields are shown once only.  The fields from the repeat are shown on individual rows.

To configure this select 'row sequence' when joining the views together.
