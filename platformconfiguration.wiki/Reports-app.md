The Reports app integrates with any other App that you use in your community.  Anyone that you give access to the Reports app can use it to download any report available in the App.  Currently these can be downloaded as XLS or PDF files.

There is also an option to create a JSON feed, which enables you to push the data for that report into another reporting or visualisation tool (such as Tableau, Power BI or Zoho Reports).

Administrators can also use the App to create new reports or modify existing ones.  These then become available for other people to use.

Reports can draw on any field from any App in your community.  The Reports app creates a single data dictionary that draws from all your Apps.  If you use an App to import data from another system, this offers the option for integrated reporting across different systems.

Reports run off a separate database to ensure that they do not impact the performance of your community.
