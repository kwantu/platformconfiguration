There are three databases in the Kwantu platform as can be seen in this page [The 3 top-level databases of the Kwantu platform:](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Create-an-app#the-3-top-level-databases-of-the-kwantu-platform) in this [page on Creating an app](https://github.com/kwantu/platformconfiguration/wiki/Create-an-app) <br>

The "config database", also known as the "Config bucket", is the same thing by a different name.
